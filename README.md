# Chess
This is a simple GUI for playing chess between two human players. You can click on a piece to see what legal moves are available for it and click on one of those cells to move it to that cell. 

Also checkout my other project [ssehc](https://github.com/aman333nolawz/ssehc) for chess in c++ and with more features like playing with AI!
